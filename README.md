# llm-detectAIgenerated_txt
Overview
The AI-Generated Text Detection project addresses the increasing sophistication of large language models (LLMs) that can generate text difficult to distinguish from human-written content. This competition challenges participants to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately detecting whether an essay was written by a student or an LLM.
Objectives
Identify and differentiate essays authored by students from those generated by LLMs.
Choice of model

The chosen primary model for this task is the Support Vector Machine (SVM), a versatile machine learning algorithm well-regarded for its prowess in classification tasks. Within the context of distinguishing between human and AI-generated text, the SVM emerges as a resilient selection. Trained on a labeled dataset of essays, this SVM diligently examines features extracted from the text using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization technique. This methodology empowers the model to adeptly discern patterns and deliver accurate predictions.
## Dependencies

- Python 3.8
- NumPy 1.19.5
- pandas 1.2.3
- spaCy  (dependency for `import spacy`)
- scikit-learn 0.24.2  (dependency for `from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, StratifiedKFold, GridSearchCV`)
- nltk (dependency for `import nltk`)
- matplotlib (dependency for `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`)
## Features

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:**
   - Import and load data using Pandas.
   - Display a summary of the dataset, including the counts of generated and non-generated essays.

2. **Text Cleaning:**
   - Utilize spaCy for natural language processing.
   - Remove stop words and punctuation from the text data.
   - Apply lemmatization to obtain cleaned text.

3. **Feature Extraction:**
   - Use TfidfVectorizer from scikit-learn to convert cleaned text data into TF-IDF features.
   - Set specific parameters like `max_features`, `min_df`, `max_df`, and `ngram_range`.

4. **Model Training and Tuning:**
   - Implement a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model using scikit-learn's SVC.
   - Utilize GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.

5. **Cross-Validation and Evaluation:**
   - Use StratifiedKFold for cross-validation.
   - Calculate and print the average accuracy.

6. **Prediction and Submission:**
   - Apply the trained model to make predictions on the test set.
   - Generate a submission file using Pandas.
## Conclusion

In conclusion, the AI-Generated Text Detection project leverages a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model trained on TF-IDF features to distinguish between student-written essays and those generated by large language models (LLMs). This initiative is driven by the aim to address concerns in educational settings related to the potential impact of LLMs on student learning, including plagiarism.

By applying state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, we strive to provide an effective solution for identifying AI-generated content. The transparent and accurate nature of our approach contributes to a more authentic educational experience, empowering educators to maintain the integrity of student work.
